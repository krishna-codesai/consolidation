What the consolidation program does:
Two players play a dice game where they have to score the most points and if they "tuple out" they will earn 0 points for that round. 
There is a random number generator from 1 to 6 for the dice so that each player cannot get a number below 1 or above 6.
They have a choice to reroll as many times as they desire until they decide to stop to gain the highest number of points they can get. 
Three dice are rolled per player and all three of them get added to generate the highest number of points per round, then the points
get tracked throughout every round till the first player reaches around 100 points. Then they win.
If the player re-rolls and gets two of the same numbers out of the 3, those two numbers stay fixed so that they have a higher risk of "tupling out" if they reroll.

How a user can run the code:
Start by right clicking the code running it in the python terminal.
The code will then output three numbers for player 1 and that user has the yes or no option whether to keep the numbers or re-roll for a better chance.
Then once they are satisfied with their three dice outputs they can answer no to the re-roll question and it moves onto player 2 and they repeat the same
steps as player 1 did.
Both players have the ability to re-roll as many times as they want till they "tuple out" or are happy with the sum of their dice points.
Then both players continue playing the game till one of the players reach 100 points. 
The player that reaches 100 points first then wins and the program stops.
